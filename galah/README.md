# Are you lost?

The names for each of the components of Galah, though appropriate in their own
right, may not be entirely clear to new developers or those just browsing
Galah's source code. Therefore, if you are confused, please quickly read over
the
[Technical Overview](https://github.com/galah-group/galah/wiki/Technical-Overview)
that will quickly help you understand the overall structure of the entire
system. I promise, it won't take long to read.

There is lots of other good documentation in the wiki that you might want to
check out too!
