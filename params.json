Check\r\nout this\r\n[comparison to similar software](https://github.com/brownhead/galah/wiki/Comparison-to-Similar-Software).\r\n\r\n## Documentation and Getting Started\r\n\r\nDocumentation for Galah is maintained on the\r\n[GitHub project's wiki](https://github.com/brownhead/galah/wiki). This\r\ndocumentation is meant to be useful to users of Galah, interested parties\r\nlooking to see if Galah would be useful to them, and developers.\r\n\r\n## Current Status\r\n\r\nVersion 0.1 is stable and ready to be used within a production environment. This\r\nfirst version is only a submission system and does not perform any testing on\r\nstudent's code.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.2 is unstable but highly useable (and is being used already).\r\n\r\n## News\r\n\r\n### Wednesday, January 30, 2013\r\n\r\nA rapid release cycle has started on the version 0.2 branch.\r\n[Galah has been deployed at UCR](https://galah.cs.ucr.edu) and the full\r\nauto-testing functionality is being used. This week we had the first series of\r\nlabs taking advantage of Galah and it went very well. Students seemed to\r\nappreciate the quickness and quality of the feedback they got. We'll be using\r\nthe feedback from this round of labs and improving things appropriately.\r\n\r\nWe're on track for a stable 0.2 release by the time the next quarter start.\r\n\r\n### Wednesday, December 5, 2012\r\n\r\nVersion 0.1 has been released and is going into deployment at UCR :D. Any bug\r\nfixes to the current code will be committed to master and releases will be made\r\nfollowing the pattern 0.1.RELEASE#, so the first bug fix release will be 0.1.1,\r\nand the thirteenth would be 0.1.13.\r\n\r\nA new branch will be created named v0.2dev and development towards the 0.2\r\nrelease will proceed there. Bug fixes made in master will be merged into that\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\n### Monday, June 25, 2012\r\n\r\nChanging version scheme to something a little less ridiculous. I don't really\r\nknow what my version scheme was before but now I'll follow more standard\r\nconventions. MajorVersion.MinorVersion.Patch[rc#], in other words what you'd\r\nexpect. I will refer to the previous release 0.1beta1 as 0.1rc1 from now on.\r\nThe next \"release\" will be 0.1rc2. When I feel confident that a lot of the\r\nbugs are worked out we'll release 0.1.\r\n\r\nEach component of Galah is pretty distinct and decoupled from the other\r\ncomponenets of Galah but I don't want to make multiple repositories for each\r\nunless each one grows very large in size (which they shouldn't), so there\r\nwon't be seperate versioning for each component.\r\n\r\n### Sunday, June 24, 2012\r\n\r\nVersion 0.1beta1 has been released. This release contains only galah.web and\r\ngalah.db running without support for interacting with the testing backend. All\r\nfunctionality needed for deploying in a production environment is there and\r\nmost of it is documented.\r\n\r\nExciting day today :).\r\n","name":"Galah","tagline":"An automated grading system geared towards processing computer programming assignments.","google":""}
