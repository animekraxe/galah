What is Galah?
==============

Galah is a teaching utility that automatically analyzes students' code as
they create it and provides feedback to both the students and the instructors.
It does this by continually running tests on students' code aand providing the
results to both the instructors and the students.

Professors are responsible for creating test harnesses for their assignments,
aside from that Galah does the rest of the work: running those tests inside of
a secure VM; consolodating results into a database; and providing an interface
for the students and teachers to see the results of the testing.

Deadline

I have ceased attending my university this quarter to finish this, thus I am
working on a tight deadline. If you can help me you have no idea how
appreciative I would be. This project is my (John Sullivan's) life right now.
