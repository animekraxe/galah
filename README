License has not been decided upon. All code is copyright by John Sullivan. It
will be open sourced soon under a proper license, just wait. Note that for the
moment however you don't have any rights to use this code except to look at
it and learn from it.

If your anxious to start doing stuff though it will probably be licensed under
the GNU General Public License or something akin to it (some copyleft license).
So you can start working under that premise and you probably won't run into
trouble.
