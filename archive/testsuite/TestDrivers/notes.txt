Notes:

Testable: A program, or code, which may may be tested by Galah. Examples would include a
	student's source code, or a student's compiled program.
Test: A single test which is run on a Testable and produces a correctness value at least.
	A test may also produce comments, an attention flag, and any other data that it wants
	to make available to the caller of the Test Suite.
Test Harness: A program which is run on a specific Testable. This is what instructors would
	write to define what a successful program is. A Test Harness may define one or more Tests
	within itself. Because scripts may be written in any language, your file must begin with
	#!INTERPRETER if the file requires an interpreter. INTERPRETER will not be treated as a
	path, rather its base name will be taken and galah will find a suitable installed interpeter
	by matching it with its lookup table. If the file does not begine with #! then it will be
	executed as a binary file.
	A Test Harness recieves the following from the test driver: tests to perform, testables, and
	any additional parameters added in the suite configuration. This information will be a subset
	of the Suite Configuration.
Test Driver: A program that executes Test Harnesss on a testable and performs any common initial
	work required by a class of Test Harnesss (aka all the Test Harnesss that will be run by the
	Test Driver). A Test Driver may perform all of the work itself if it makes more sense to
	do so. Either way however, it must support the common Test Driver interface.
	A test driver recieves the following from the test suite: tests to perform, testables, and
	any additional parameters added in the suite configuration.
	Specifically a Test Driver receives a SuiteConfiguration JSON object:
	-SuiteConfiguration : Object
		-testables : List
			List of paths, each one pointing to a testable.
		-actions : List
			List of driver defined objects. # SuiteConfiguration.Harness objects.
		-config : Object
			Object containing driver defined configuration data.
			
	-SuiteConfiguration.Harness : Object
		-path : String
			Path pointing to a Test Harness.
		-info : Object [Optional]
			An object containing any additional information that was sent with the request
			associated with this particular script.
		-tests: List<String>
			A list of strings containing the names of the tests to be executed by this script.
			
	A Test Driver should output a DriverResult JSON object:
	-DriverResult : Object
		-results : List<TestResult>
		-errors : List<FailedAction>
	-FailedAction : Object
		-testable : String
			The testable that this failed action concerns.
		-message : String
			Description of the failure.
	-TestResult : Object
		-name : String
			The name of the test that produced this result.
		-testable : String
			The testable this result concerns
		-score : Number
			The number of points scored.
		-score_max : Number
			The max number of possible points one could score.
		-inconclusive : Boolean
			True iff a result is inconclusive and should be reviewed.
		-messages : List<String>
			A list of messages related to this result.
			
Test Suite: Program that handles execution of the Test Drivers on a given testable and brings
	together the results from every driver. The term Test Suite can also mean to include the
	Test Drivers as well.
Suite Configuration: A Suite Configuration specifies Test Drivers, Test Harnesss, and Tests to
	run, but does not specify the Testables.
	
A Test Harness may recieve the testable in different ways:
1. The Driver can send the Script a JSON object through standard input which has the following
	fields: enabled_tests,
